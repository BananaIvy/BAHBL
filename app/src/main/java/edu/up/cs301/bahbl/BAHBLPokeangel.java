/**
* A computer-version of a counter-player.  Since this is such a simple game,
* it just sends "+" and "-" commands with equal probability, at an average
* rate of one per second. This computer player does, however, have an option to
* display the game as it is progressing, so if there is no human player on the
* device, this player will display a GUI that shows the value of the counter
* as the game is being played.
